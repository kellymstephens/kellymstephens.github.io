                <h1>About</h1>
                
                <p>I am currently a Senior who will be graduating from the University of Florida this May 2015 with Bachelors of Arts in English (summa cum laude) and History (cum laude), and a minor in Educational Studies.  After this chapter ends, I am incredibly excited to start penning the newest chapter in my life: starting my career with writing, media, and people.  As a storyteller and people-person more generally, I enjoy combining my skills to create communities, smiles, and memorable moments that last for years to come.</p>  
                    
                <p>During my time at UF, I have been involved in a variety of organizations and programs that have enabled me to develop my leadership- and writing skills while giving back to the university, Gainesville, and the national and international communities.  While some of these experiences are featured briefly on my <a href="resume.html">resume page</a>, I have further highlighted some of my experiences below. </p>

            <h2><a name="work-experience">Work Experience</a></h2>
                <p>As an undergraduate, I have focused on both honing and diversifying my skills throughout my various work experiences, which have spanned the roles of substitute teacher, sales associate, editor, and writer.  During my time as a substitute teacher and sales associate, I have especially enjoyed working with people, whether I am managing a classroom of students or serving my customers.  Meanwhile, I have also worked to further craft my writing skills, both as an editor at a fast-paced business that creates educational supplements and as a blogger on my young-adult fiction blog.  Through my blog, I have found that I really love working with writing, technology, and people on social media platforms like WordPress and Twitter, and I’m hoping to dive deeper into this field once I graduate.</p>
            
            <h2><a name="english-society">English Society</a></h2>
                <p>One of my biggest joys while at UF has been working with and leading an undergraduate club known as English Society, which works to provide resources and support for UF’s English majors and minors.  An active member for four years and an officer for three, I have been very involved with the club.  For three years I was a prose editor in its subsidiary branch and literary magazine, <i>Tea</i>, where I worked with a team of editors to acquire pieces, discuss edits, and then communicate those edits with authors in one-on-one meetings.  During my Sophomore year, I also became the chair of English Society’s Writing Collective, a club that acted as a forum where undergraduate writers could workshop their pieces and further develop their writing and critiquing abilities.  As chair, I led these meetings and created workshop lesson plans and prompts.  On a larger scale, I also worked with other officers to generate general body meetings and events to create a welcoming and helpful community within the English Department.</p>
                <p><i><b>Mentoring Program</b></i></p>
                <p>During my first two years as an undergrad in the English major, I had realized that many of my classmates felt lost within the department, unsure of whom to approach for advice and guidance when it came to choosing classes, finding internships, or navigating the various honors tracks within the department.  On top of that, many underclassmen did not know what types of jobs would be available to them once they graduated, nor did they know how to go about utilizing their skills in those job markets.  As someone who has always loved teaching and helping people, I felt the need to fill this gap: to create a connection between high-performing upperclassmen and the new or younger students who wanted guidance.</p>
                <p>Thus, English Society’s Mentoring Program was born.</p>
                <p>Using the research I had gathered and the connections I had created with professors, advisors, and other organizations during my first two years at UF, I have worked during my Junior and Senior years to found and lead a healthy Mentoring Program that matches upper- and lowerclassmen with similar career aspirations, personalities, and experiences.  In doing so, I have tried to create a community within the English Department that not only helps English majors network, but also helps prepare them as leaders and future mentors in the fields they join after graduation. Creating social events and providing problem resolutions within mentor-mentee pairings, I have really enjoyed creating this program, even as I have continued to coordinate with other English Society officers to create meetings and events that will help undergrads connect with professors, find internships, build resumes, and get international experience by studying abroad.</p>
            <h2><a name="community-service">Community Service</a></h2>
                <p>Throughout my undergrad career, I have always worked to give back to my community through volunteer work.  For instance, through the academic honors society Delta Epsilon Iota, I volunteered multiple times at Relay for Life and UF’s Career Showcase. During my Junior year, I also came across the great opportunity to partner with United Way as a Reading Pal in its Reading Pals program, which works to increase literacy levels among struggling 2nd and 3rd grade students.  This type of project is near and dear to my heart, especially since I also struggled with reading as a kid, and I knew I couldn’t pass up the opportunity.  As a result, over the course of two semesters I worked with and mentored my Reading Pal, an enthusiastic and wonderful 8-year-old girl.  I absolutely loved getting to know and helping her, and was so proud of the progress she made even over the course of one year.</p>
                <p>My passion for people and education has also extended to my volunteer work with middle schools and high schools, where I have acted as classroom aids for language arts and English classes.  Working with a variety of students from diverse backgrounds over the past four years, I have helped teachers implement lesson plans by creating mini-lessons and fun projects; grading assessments; and helping students one-on-one and in small groups with writing, reading, and any math homework they may have.</p>
            <h2><a name="gator-marching-band">Gator Marching Band</a></h2>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4fizD2baw8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>As an avid music lover, I have been an active member in UF’s Gator Marching Band for all four years of my college career.  Although the many rehearsals are outside in the hot and tempestuous Florida weather, I have absolutely loved being a part of this large, diverse team that works to give back to the university and the larger community through its half-time shows, community outreach events, and public appearances.  Perhaps one of my most exciting memories with the band was when we were invited to play in front of Buckingham palace and other venues at the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games.  I have never been more proud to represent my university and the United States.</p>
                <p>As much as Gator band works to entertain, we also work to give back to our community. The above YouTube video is one of our half-time shows. This particular show worked to raise funds and awareness for UF Health’s Children’s Miracle Network, which works to cure and treat children with life-threatening diseases and cancer. </p>
            <h2><a name="study-abroad-and-research-experience">Study Abroad and Research Expereince</a></h2>
                <p>As an English and history double-major, I am used to sorting through a lot of material and viewpoints to fashion a strong narrative and convincing argument.  I have always enjoyed doing this, which is why I have taken various opportunities to strengthen my research and writing skills: first, with a research-oriented study abroad program, and later with UF’s University Scholars Program and my English Honors Thesis.</p>
                <p>During the summer before my Senior year, I was part of a small group of students who were accepted into the UF in Cambridge program, which gave us the opportunity to study abroad and do humanities research in Paris and England for four weeks. Exploring such historic places as Versailles, Notre Dame, Stonehenge, and the Globe Theater, my study abroad was an amazing trip that enabled me to broaden my horizons both as a person and a writer.  Perhaps one of the most exciting parts for me was the three weeks I spent at Cambridge University and its incredible libraries, which I used to support my research on British class tensions between the aristocracy and the rising middle classes during the 19th century.</p>
                <p>During my Senior year, I developed my research and presentation skills still further as one of UF’s University Scholars.  Having received funding to conduct research under an English faculty member, I examined socio-ethical ideologies in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series.  My research, which I presented at a research symposium and later submitted to a journal for publication, was later expounded upon in my 54-page English Honors Thesis.  </p>
